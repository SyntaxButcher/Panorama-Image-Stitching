# Panorama-Image-Stitching

This repository contains the implementation of a camera calibration and image stitching algorithm to create panoramas using Harris features. The code is tested on various scenes including a mural, cinderblock wall, and graffiti wall. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of Harris corner detection for feature extraction in image stitching applications.
